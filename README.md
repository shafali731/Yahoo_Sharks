## Lab03

## Methods (Array Priority Queue):
* add(String x)
  This method adds to the end of the ArrayList and it had a runtime of O(1)
* peekMin()
  This method returns the smallest element of the ArrayList and has a runtime of O(n)
* removeMin()
  This method removes and returns the smallest element of the ArrayList and has a runtime of O(n)
* isEmpty()
  This method returns whether or not the ArrayList is empty with a runtime of O(1)

## Decision:
  We chose to use the methods from the API because it has to adopt the properties of a Queue and that is that it can only add at the end of the ArrayList.
  
## Heap To Do
  - [ ] 1. public ALHeap()
  - [ ] 2. public String toString
  - [ ] 3. public boolean isEmpty()
  - [ ] 4. public Integer peekMin()
  - [ ] 5. public void add (Integer addVal)
  - [ ] 6. private minChildPos(int pos)
  - [ ] 7. public Integer removeMin()
