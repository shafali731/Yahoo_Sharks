# Yahoo_Sharks (Shafali Gupta, Bing Li)
## Lab03
## Methods:
* add(String x)
  This method adds to the end of the ArrayList and it had a runtime of O(1)
* peekMin()
  This method returns the smallest element of the ArrayList and has a runtime of O(n)
* removeMin()
  This method removes and returns the smallest element of the ArrayList and has a runtime of O(n)
* isEmpty()
  This method returns whether or not the ArrayList is empty with a runtime of O(1)

## Decision:
  We chose to use the methods from the API because it has to adopt the properties of a Queue and that is that it can only add at the end of the ArrayList.
